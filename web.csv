Endpoints Discovered,"Endpoints discovered refer to the process where attackers identify various API or web application endpoints that are publicly accessible or exposed. These endpoints can reveal valuable information about the application's structure, functionality, and available services. Attackers can leverage this information to gain insights into how the application works, what data it handles, and potential vulnerabilities in the exposed endpoints. Once endpoints are discovered, attackers can use this information to probe for vulnerabilities, exploit security weaknesses, or manipulate the application's data and behavior.","The impact of discovering endpoints in an application can vary depending on the level of exposure and the sensitivity of the endpoints: <ul class=""list-disc pt-2 pl-4""> <li><strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> Attackers who discover endpoints may attempt to access them directly, potentially bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, functionalities, or resources.</li> <li><strong>Reconnaissance:</strong> Knowledge of endpoints can provide attackers with valuable information about the structure and functionality of an application. This can aid in planning and executing targeted attacks.</li> <li><strong>Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:</strong> If the endpoints have vulnerabilities, attackers may exploit them to gain access to the application or its data. This can lead to data breaches, account takeovers, or other forms of exploitation.</li> <li><strong>Manipulation of Data:</strong> Attackers may use discovered endpoints to manipulate data within the application. This can include altering records, injecting malicious data, or disrupting normal operations.</li> </ul>",INFO,"Discovering endpoints can occur through techniques such as: <ul class=""list-disc pt-2 pl-4""> <li><strong>Web Crawling:</strong> Scanning the application's publicly accessible URLs and directories to discover available endpoints.</li> <li><strong>Brute Forcing:</strong> Systematically trying different URL patterns or parameter combinations to uncover hidden endpoints.</li> <li><strong>Reverse Engineering:</strong> Analyzing client-side code, such as JavaScript files, or network traffic to identify and map application endpoints.</li> </ul>","To address the risks associated with the discovery of endpoints, organizations should implement the following suggested fixes: <ul class=""list-disc pt-2 pl-4""> <li><strong>Proper Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Secure endpoints by requiring authentication and authorization checks for all requests. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to endpoints based on user roles and permissions.</li> <li><strong>Rate Limiting and Throttling:</strong> Implement rate limiting and request throttling to prevent attackers from exploiting endpoints through brute-force attacks or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.</li> <li><strong>Input Validation and Output Encoding:</strong> Validate all input data to ensure it meets expected criteria and avoid injection attacks. Encode output data to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks.</li> <li><strong>Secure API Design:</strong> Follow best practices for secure API design, such as using HTTPS for all communication, avoiding unnecessary data exposure, and using secure tokens for authentication.</li> <li><strong>Minimize Endpoint Exposure:</strong> Limit the number of publicly accessible endpoints to only those necessary for the application's functionality. Hide internal or administrative endpoints behind secure firewalls or VPNs.</li> </ul>",2.1,CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,list,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Directory Listing Enabled,"Web servers can be configured to automatically list the contents of directories that do not have an index page present. This can aid an attacker by enabling them to quickly identify the resources at a given path, and proceed directly to analyzing and attacking those resources. It particularly increases the exposure of sensitive files within the directory that are not intended to be accessible to users, such as temporary files and crash dumps.<p class=""pt-3"">Directory listings themselves do not necessarily constitute a security vulnerability. Any sensitive resources within the web root should in any case be properly access-controlled, and should not be accessible by an unauthorized party who happens to know or guess the URL. Even when directory listings are disabled, an attacker may guess the location of sensitive files using automated tools.</p>","<ul class=""list-disc pl-4""> <li><strong>Sensitive Files:</strong> Directory listings can expose files that contain sensitive information, such as configuration files, backup files, or private documents. These files might include credentials, internal communications, or other confidential data.</li> <li><strong>Discovery of Hidden Resources:</strong> Attackers can discover hidden resources that are not linked or indexed, such as admin panels, test files, or deprecated scripts.</li> <li><strong>Identification of Vulnerable Files:</strong> Attackers can identify and exploit files with known vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated scripts with security flaws).</li> <li><strong>Website Structure Insight:</strong> Attackers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the website's directory structure, making it easier to identify important files and directories.</li> </ul>",MEDIUM,"Discovering endpoints can occur through techniques such as: <ul class=""list-disc pt-2 pl-4""> <li><strong>Web Crawling:</strong> Scanning the application's publicly accessible URLs and directories to discover available endpoints.</li> <li><strong>Brute Forcing:</strong> Systematically trying different URL patterns or parameter combinations to uncover hidden endpoints.</li> <li><strong>Reverse Engineering:</strong> Analyzing client-side code, such as JavaScript files, or network traffic to identify and map application endpoints.</li> </ul>","There is not usually any good reason to provide directory listings, and disabling them may place additional hurdles in the path of an attacker. This can normally be achieved in two ways: <ul class=""list-disc pt-2 pl-4 pb-3""> <li>Configure your web server to prevent directory listings for all paths beneath the web root;</li> <li>Place into each directory a default file (such as index.htm) that the web server will display instead of returning a directory listing.</li><li> Disable directory listing in the web server configuration (e.g., using .htaccess for Apache or nginx.conf for NGINX).</li> <li> Implement proper access controls to restrict unauthorized access to directories. </li> </ul> For <strong>Apache</strong> web server, disabling directory listing can be achieved by adding the following line to the <i>.htaccess</i> file or the server configuration: <div class=""my-2 mx-5 p-2 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg text-xs italic""> <p class=""py-1""> Options -Indexes</p> </div> For <strong>NGINX</strong>, the following directive can be added to the server block: <div class=""my-2 mx-5 p-2 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg text-xs italic""> <p class=""py-1""> autoindex off;</p> </div>",5.3,CWE-548: Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing,list,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Insecure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing Configuration,"Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain. It extends and adds flexibility to the same-origin policy (SOP). However, it also provides potential for cross-domain attacks, if a website's CORS policy is poorly configured and implemented. CORS is not a protection against cross-origin attacks such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF).<p class=""pt-2"">CORS Misconfiguration occurs when a web application's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy is improperly configured, allowing unauthorized domains to access restricted resources.

Missing Security Headers,"Missing security headers refers to the absence of HTTP headers that enhance the security of web applications and protect against common attacks. These headers provide instructions to web browsers on how to handle certain aspects of web pages, such as content type, origin policy, caching behavior, and scripts execution. Common security headers that may be missing include: <ul class=""list-disc pt-2 pl-4""> <li><strong>Content Security Policy (CSP):</strong> Helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks by specifying which sources and types of content are allowed to be loaded and executed on the page.</li> <li><strong>HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):</strong> Forces browsers to connect to the server using a secure HTTPS connection and protects against downgrade attacks.</li> <li><strong>X-Content-Type-Options:</strong> Protects against MIME type sniffing, which can lead to the execution of malicious content.</li> <li><strong>X-Frame-Options:</strong> Prevents clickjacking attacks by controlling whether the page can be embedded within an iframe.</li> <li><strong>X-XSS-Protection:</strong> Provides basic XSS filtering capabilities and instructs the browser to block or sanitize the page if an XSS attack is detected.</li> <li><strong>Referrer-Policy:</strong> Controls the information sent in the Referer header, protecting user privacy by limiting data leakage.</li> </ul>","The impact of having missing or misconfigured security headers can be detrimental to the security and privacy of a web application and its users: <ul class=""list-disc pt-2 pl-4""> <li><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks:</strong> Without a properly configured Content Security Policy (CSP) header, the application is more vulnerable to XSS attacks. Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.</li> <li><strong>Clickjacking Attacks:</strong> The absence of the X-Frame-Options header allows attackers to embed the web application within an iframe and trick users into clicking on hidden or deceptive content. This can result in unauthorized actions being performed, such as changing user settings or executing transactions.</li> <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:</strong> Missing the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header can expose the application to man-in-the-middle attacks, where attackers intercept and manipulate data transmitted between the user and the server. This can lead to data breaches, privacy violations, and tampering with sensitive information.</li> <li><strong>MIME Type Sniffing:</strong> Without the X-Content-Type-Options header set to ""nosniff,"" the browser may attempt to determine the content type of a response based on its content rather than the declared content type. This can lead to unintended content execution or the display of malicious content, posing security risks.</li> <li><strong>Information Leakage:</strong> The absence of the Referrer-Policy header can result in unintentional exposure of user data, such as the URL of the referring page. This can lead to privacy concerns and potential data leakage.</li> <li><strong>Data Integrity Risks:</strong> Without the X-XSS-Protection header, the application lacks basic protection against XSS attacks. This can impact data integrity and user trust in the application's ability to secure their information.</li> </ul>",MEDIUM,"During the scan, the following security headers were missing from the response headers:","<p><strong>Content Security Policy (CSP)</strong><p> <div class=""px-5 mb-3""> Configuring Content Security Policy involves adding the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header to a web page and giving it values to control w2at resources the user agent is allowed to load for that page. For example, a page that uploads and displays images could allow images from anywhere, but restrict a form action to a specific endpoint. A properly designed Content Security Policy helps protect a page against a cross-site scripting attack. <div class=""my-2 mx-5 p-2 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg text-xs w-fit italic""> <p class=""py-1"">Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'</p> <p class=""py-1"">Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' example.com *.example.com</p> <p class=""py-1"">Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src *; media-src example.net; script-src scripts.example.com</p> </div> </div> <p><strong>Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)</strong><p> <div class=""px-5 mb-3""> If a website accepts a connection through HTTP and redirects to HTTPS, visitors may initially communicate with the non-encrypted version of the site before being redirected, if, for example, the visitor types http://www.foo.com/ or even just foo.com. This creates an opportunity for a man-in-the-middle attack. The redirect could be exploited to direct visitors to a malicious site instead of the secure version of the original site. <p>The HTTP Strict Transport Security header informs the browser that it should never load a site using HTTP and should automatically convert all attempts to access the site using HTTP to HTTPS requests instead.<p> <div class=""my-2 mx-5 p-2 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg text-xs w-fit italic""> <p class=""py-1"">Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=&lt;expire-time&gt;</p> <p class=""py-1"">Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=&lt;expire-time&gt;; includeSubDomains</p> <p class=""py-1"">Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=&lt;expire-time&gt;; includeSubDomains; preload</p> </div> </div> <p><strong>X-Content-Type-Options</strong><p> <div class=""px-5 mb-3""> The X-Content-Type-Options response HTTP header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should be followed and not be changed.
